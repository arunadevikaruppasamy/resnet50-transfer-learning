# resnet50-transfer-learning
This implementation considers the following cases:
1. Pretrained ResNet-50 Model - optimized with cross-entropy loss (only last layer is optimized)
2. Pretrained ResNet-50 Model - optimized with cross-entropy loss (all layers are optimized)
3. Pretrained ResNet-50 Model - optimized with Hinge loss (only last layer is optimized)
4. Pretrained ResNet-50 Model - optimized with Hinge loss (all layers are optimized)
5. ResNet-50 implementation, trained with cross-entropy loss
6. ResNet-50 implementation, trained with Hinge loss

## figures for the results will be added...
